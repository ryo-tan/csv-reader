# CSV Reader

CSV Reader is an application that reads and displays data from an uploaded CSV File.

## Getting Started

Install the required packages by running:
```bash
npm install
```
Run the application:
```bash
npm start
```

## Supported Browsers
- Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox

## Assumptions
### CSV Files
This project assumes that the CSV file will be in a format where the data header is in the first row.

## Future Roadmap
Extend `create-react-app` eslint configuration to fix current warning
```bash
'React' was used before it was defined  @typescript-eslint/no-use-before-define
```
